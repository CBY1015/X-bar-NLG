# X-bar-NLG
This project is an advanced natural language generation system that combines Chomsky's X-bar Theory with a hierarchical, three-level neural network architecture. It generates coherent discourse by first creating a syntactic blueprint (a parse tree) and then expanding it, rather than just predicting word sequences.
